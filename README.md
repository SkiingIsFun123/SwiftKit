## About SwiftKit

`SwiftKit` adds functionality to `Swift`, both extensions to existing types and components, as well as custom useful functionality.

You can read more about the different parts of `SwiftKit` in separate readmes:

* [Authentication][Authentication]
* [Bundle][Bundle]
* [Coding][Coding]
* [Data][Data]
* [Date][Date]
* [Device][Device]
* [Extensions][Extensions]
* [Files][Files]
* [Geo][Geo]
* [IoC][IoC]
* [Keychain][Keychain]
* [Network][Network]

If things that exist in this library are added to `Swift`, the corresponding functionality in this library will be deprecated and refer to those new features.


## Demo App

This project contains a demo app that lets you explore `SwiftKit` through interactive demos. 

The demo app provides an intuitive way to explore the library. Together with the extensive documentation and SwiftUI previews, I hope you'll find it easy to understand how the various parts of the library works.

To run the demo app, just open and run the `Demo/Demo.xcodeproj` project. `macOS` is currenty not supported.


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftKit.git
```

### CocoaPods

```
pod DSSwiftKit
```

Note that you have to import `SwiftKit` with `import DSSwiftKit` if you add it with CocoaPods. The name `SwiftKit` was (not surprising) already taken.
