# Release notes


## 1.0

After a lot of waiting and stabilizing, I think it's time to push the major release button.

There are no drastic changes, but I use this in most of my projects and find it very helpful and stable.  

This version drastically improves documentation and ships with a DocC documentation archive. 



## 0.7.0

This version requires Xcode 13 and later, since it refers to the latest api:s.

This version also cleans up the code and makes changes to conform to the latest standards. 

### âœ¨ New features

* `Calendar+Date` has new `same` functions to provide the comparison date.
* `DispatchQueue+Throttle` has new `throttle` and `debounce` functions.
* `String+Split` has a new `split(by:)` components splitting function.
* `Url+Global` has a new `userSubscriptions` url.

### ðŸ’¥ Breaking changes

* All previously deprecated features have been removed.
* `ApiService` moves the `type` param before the `httpMethod`, since `httpMethod` now has a default value.
* `ApiRoute` and `ApiService` now use enum-based HTTP methods instead of string-based ones.
* `DispatchQueue+Async` now requires that you explicitly define `seconds` when using that `asyncAfter` function.
* `URL+Global` `appStoreUrl(forAppId:)` now returns an optional url.

### ðŸ’¡ Behavior changes

### ðŸ’¥ Breaking changes

* `ApiRoute` requires new post properties to be defined.



## 0.5.0

This version adjusts code that made the demo not being able to use the SPM package instead of the source files.

### âœ¨ New features

* `ApiError` is a new enum that replaces the old `ApiServiceError`.
* `FileExporter` is a new protocol for exporting data to the file system.
* `MimeType` is a new enum for simplifying working with mime types.

### ðŸ—‘ Deprecations
