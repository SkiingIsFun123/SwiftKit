/**
 This class can be used to manage store information in a way
 that makes it observable.
 
 Since the `Product` type isn't `Codable`, `products` is not
 permanently persisted, which means that this information is
 reset if the app restarts. Due to this, any changes to this
 property will also update `productIds`, which gives you the
 option to map the IDs to a local product representation and
 present previously fetched products.
 
 Note however that a `Product` instance is needed to perform
 a purchase.
