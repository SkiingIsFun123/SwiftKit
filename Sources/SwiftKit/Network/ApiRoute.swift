/**
 This enum represents an external api route, e.g. fetching a
 logged in user's profile.
 
 The only requirement of an api route is that is must have a
 path and params, that together with an `ApiEnvironment` can
 be used to create a complete url to the route.
 
 The difference between routes and endpoints, is that routes
 are addresses to one or multiple endpoints. A route to e.g.
 `xxx/blog/123` can have endpoints for `GET`, `POST` etc.
 
 SwiftKit currently only uses `ApiEnvironment` and `ApiRoute`.
